This is a sample Unity3D Project displaying video from an Mjpg stream.

To use:

1. Open "Mjpg Viewer/Assets/Scenes/Sample Mjpeg Viewer.unity" in Unity3D.

2. Play the Sample Mjpeg Viewer scene.

3. (Optional) Open a web browser and go to http://extcam-16.se.axis.com and click the "Start Train" button to move the model train. You can then test the latency and framerate by watching the stream in the Unity3D window.

Enjoy!
